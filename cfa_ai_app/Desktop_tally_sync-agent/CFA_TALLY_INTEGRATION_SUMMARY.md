data = fetch_comprehensive_client_data("20241001", "20250131")

# Process for CFA calculations
for client in data['clients']:
    # Process client data for AI analysis
    process_client_for_cfa(client)
```

### Method 2: TDL File Export

**Advantages**:
- Native Tally integration

### Method 3: Direct XML Requests

**Advantages**:
- Maximum control over data extraction
- Custom filtering options
- Real-time data access
- Programmatic integration

**Usage**:
```xml
<ENVELOPE>
    <HEADER>
        <TALLYREQUEST>Export Data</TALLYREQUEST>
    </HEADER>
    <BODY>
        <EXPORTDATA>
            <REQUESTDESC>
                <REPORTNAME>Ledger</REPORTNAME>
                <STATICVARIABLES>
                    <SVFROMDATE>20241001</SVFROMDATE>

## CR/DR Analysis for CFA

### Understanding Balance Types

**DR (Debit)**:
- Client owes money to your company
- Positive balance in Sundry Debtors
- Negative balance in Sundry Creditors

**CR (Credit)**:
- Your company owes money to client
- Negative balance in Sundry Debtors
- Positive balance in Sundry Creditors

### Processing Logic

```python
def analyze_client_status(client_data):
    opening_balance = float(client_data['opening_balance'])
    opening_type = client_data['opening_balance_type']
    
    # Convert to standard format
    if opening_type == 'DR':
        # Client owes money
        standardized_balance = opening_balance
        status = "Debtor"
    else:
        # Client is owed money
        standardized_balance = -opening_balance
        status = "Creditor"
    
    return {
        'standardized_balance': standardized_balance,
        'status': status,
        'original_balance': opening_balance,
        'original_type': opening_type
    }
```

## Integration with CFA AI System

### 1. Data Import Pipeline

```python
def import_cfa_data(json_file):
    with open(json_file, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    
    # Process each client
    for client in data['clients']:
        # Extract client metrics
        client_metrics = extract_client_metrics(client)
        
        # Calculate AI features
        ai_features = calculate_ai_features(client_metrics)
        
        # Store in CFA database
        store_in_cfa_database(client_metrics, ai_features)
```

### 2. Real-time Sync

```python
def sync_cfa_data():
    # Fetch latest data from Tally
    data = fetch_comprehensive_client_data()
    
    # Process for CFA calculations
    processed_data = process_for_cfa(data)
    
    # Update CFA AI system
    update_cfa_ai_system(processed_data)
    
    # Trigger AI analysis
    trigger_ai_analysis(processed_data)
```

### 3. Automated Scheduling

```python
import schedule
import time

def scheduled_cfa_sync():
    data = fetch_comprehensive_client_data()
    export_client_data_to_json(data)
    sync_cfa_data()

# Schedule daily sync at 6 PM
schedule.every().day.at("18:00").do(scheduled_cfa_sync)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)
```

## Tally Configuration Requirements

### 1. Tally Server Setup
- Enable Tally Server (Gateway of Tally → Control Centre → Data Export)
- Set port to 9000 (default)
- Configure IP address if accessing remotely

### 2. Company Selection
- Ensure correct company is selected in Tally
- Verify financial year settings
- Check that all required ledgers are created

### 3. Ledger Structure
- Sundry Debtors group should contain all debtor ledgers
- Sundry Creditors group should contain all creditor ledgers
- Ensure proper naming conventions for easy identification

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Failed**
   - Check if Tally Server is running
   - Verify port 9000 is accessible
   - Check firewall settings

2. **No Data Returned**
   - Verify company selection in Tally
   - Check date range validity
   - Ensure ledgers exist in specified groups

3. **Invalid XML Response**
   - Check Tally version compatibility
   - Verify TDL file syntax
   - Review network connectivity

### Debug Steps

```python
# Test basic connection
from enhanced_tally_connector import test_enhanced_connector
test_enhanced_connector()

# Check specific client
from enhanced_tally_connector import fetch_specific_client_ledger
client_data = fetch_specific_client_ledger("Client Name", "20241001", "20250131")
```
