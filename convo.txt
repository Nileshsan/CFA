New project buddy 
Problem statement: 
You know business and how it works 
It's full of trust and money flow 
So we are going to work on that 
Mostly all the things of of business are recorded in tally 
In tally we have 4 things 
Sales 
Purchase 
Receipt 
Payment 

We get this individual report 

We will take from tally add them to our data base 
We will have some insights according to time lapse 
Like at 1 month time we will have this much money in account 

And 

We will divide the clients according to there habit of payments 
If they delay we will give them discounts 
And make them more deciplined clients 
And alll 



The main focus is 
We will have perfect specs 
On 17 we are supposed to get thsi much debit and this much credit 

This money flow we need to understand 


The application we will app for mobile 
We need very best dashboard to give analysis 

We will use tally 

Database are most important in this application we will go according to which will perform best 


If you have doubt ask me to clear 



We will get direct access of tally from each client 

I really want real time but i will prefer 0 cost to all

Cash flow ,what will in my account at 1 month tomorrow and whatever we want to know 

Yes deficits and alll alarts and all  the most important is how much will in bank account and what is going to come and go from which date 

Yes we will have admin taht is us 
Accountant who will integrate data and see 
And client for whom we are doing insights for 



We should allow users to edit entries but we will pass key for that too 



I want to go with ml 

And we will use top tier ai here

We will train deep learning models 
AI model like llms for this 

We will do best 

Listen we can't train model like before and then we will put in model 
This is all real world data all the names or clients will be different with different habits 
I am host 
I will give this service to client which will see there clients record 



Do you have any tutorial for me about tally data integration to app   
  
Please first you give me as much as info you have about it 

And understand me 

We are making an application which will pull data from that clients whole company tally data 
Which includes every transaction advance payment receipts payments 
Sales and credits 
Also exception we will detect in data 

We will predict cash flow from this data 
So data base comes as most absolutely important thing in this 
This will be saas so I want that application capabilities 

It should be best 

Data base i think we will use postgresql 

We have hostinger server 8gb ram and 2 cpu cores 

We can do postgresql database there to right 

Think about everything and tell me if this is not Enough 




i will tell me in details 
we are creating mobile applicstion 
in which we we will be  host and this application for businesses 
we will go to thwm give our app and then 
then process of flow will be 
application we will set with there tally destop or web they can have any right
then we will request all the data such as sales credit receipt and payment 
then we will from that data we will predit there cashflow 
divide there clients into catagory according to there payment behaviour 

we will make a system that will giev specific discount to the clients 
like if a client pay late we will say if you pay today this you have pay discount 
adn that discount we will graducally decrease till the date our system predictad on an average at which that client payes the bill 

and most things will be done for accountants 
and we qill make insights adn dashboard for owners 




In the current work flow we have in mobile that is front end we have app which can closed tap which includes in desktop tsx and other files we have components which have you I which contain some files also we have many chart.sx collapse external links theme view and so on transaction card.ts then we have a folder name navigation which consist of staff navigator tsx then we have creams which consist of plan and profile screen dashboard screen forecast screen login screen so how does it actually decide which component falls under which where will be login compare will be the main page come like another application of that particular app how does that define



[media pointer="file-service://file-HFosfaRc2qB55TCAfxEzvS"]
I was thinking we enter the app pbs logo came   
Then we will initiate the user for first timers the application start authentication process which includes system will ask for login credentials login with Google   
We will provide user with 2 layer login access that is 2 google accounts for 1 company   
1 for owner with more freedom  
2 for accountant who will use application i.e see there clients discount and and alarts and send them email and all we will set the exact thing later   
We will give them google accounts   
That will also feel good from user side right   
Like something new that feeling   
  
Next step in authentication process will be integrating tally data  we will take all the data of that company and make database of that   
  
Next step we will use that data and train the dl ml models   
We will predefined the ratio of data to epoch   
See each client will have different kinda clients with different paying habits and for them ideal will ge different and we will train model for there 1 year data and know there clients divide them into criteria according to there data   
Like if industry average is 30 days   
For some it may be 15 for some it may be 60   
So the late payer is different in different cases   
  
Soo we will define the machine learning deep learning logic with perfection so we won't do mess of system 


After model training we will know in which criteria to divide the clients in 
Like for someone 5 days 15 days 30 days 45 days 
So we will convert 45 days people to 30 days by giving them discounts so they will pay early 

I don't know if we need to train the model for cash flow of the business 


After all the positive confirmation from above process


We will redirect to main page 
In absolute main page where the user will come directly from second time 

This page will consist of main 
On top we will face side bar tab button on left then beside that PBS  on left profile and other services or something we roll out 

On main page first big box will be of cash flow dashboard we will give button on taht somewhere or even if we click on that we will be taken to cash flow main page we will define more about it later 

Under that another box which will have client distinguish and there behaviour of payment list 
With that written will be there today's discount and if they pay today what will be there amount and total amount display 
We won't show everything here 
When we click on it we will taken to that main page where everything will be 

We will have more function understand that we will do that later 
And on screen on bottom wr will have llm ai to chat with 
We will touch on that to type and it will open a page from bottom taht is to chat and we will give voice assist too 


Let's have this for now 
Please help me with working and how and how should I execute this in details and do you best of best 
Iw have given you photo of that's totally the most basic sample 
Most important thing in this application will be smoothness and beautiful ui 
So user experience should be ideal and they will enjoy our insights and work 




i wnat to make sure the flow 
see we are not going to do anything indivisually for ml training

and most imp we are not goimg get tally data manually 
we will request through and xml then to json then to backend request to database 

we will set everythinig in code trainig and all 
we will set the ration of data to epoch 
we will find ideal ratio which perform best 

i want to full proof solution


what I am saying the data we will get from tally then that tally data by XML and just on and all we will get into our database then in our database we will fetch some things to train our model those will be client name amount then the day at which the transaction was done and where is the amount was paid that difference is important and one will be product of different date and the amount that will give us weighted some and that we will like of course there will be multiple transaction for one single clan so we will do the average of that and get some values and we will over that value and they will get some middle value that which these are the late clients this are the good clients okay we are helping plans to get the payment earlier then we will do unique of client column and get the names of the clients and the unique values are there and from the model the estimate some values those are the range of each category and we will now do the parsing and get a task for each client 



So you are telling me 
We will create a mobile application main work 
There will be desktop small application .exe or something 
There will be tally of user company

So now 
We will give access to user for our app
He login 
Then integrate the tally by using this desktop application 
Our app will request that application data somehow 
Then that application request it to user tally 
Then we get that data on our server json 
We integrate tht data into our database and then from there later process 

Now we need to programme our application such a way 

Where will api keys will generate and all 
How will it match 
Will we give them api keys 

There are multiple companies 

Each will have there application in desktop that will have key 
And our application will have key 
When for what company api key match we will push data there 

See if we are making this then let's be proper 

We will make an .exe application with gui 
It will also have .env to store 
And i want it such a way that 
User will only click integrate button and all the process will happen 
Of first time it will be different 

But we will create a wonderful and sustainable solution 





How will this code connect with main app code 
Django server it will align right 


See the django backend then that will be server 
Postgresql our data base where we will have everything saved 

We have ui of mobile 
We have desktop .exe ui 
We have user tally thing 


Mobile application downloaded 
.exe loaded 

Mobile app open 
We given login credentials enter 
And authentication process step 2 

We wil make an api key 
Display it to copy as well as scan as qr 

Then we will open .exe in desktop 
It will ask for api key 
We will enter it or open camera to scan phone qr and auto fill 
Then now this api key will be stored in .env 
So from second time it will automatically load and then connect with tally and get data 
Then we will send taht data to django backend and integrate it to database 

In mobile app we will get the successfully linked with the tally and desktop application 
And data is fetched and training the ai for customisation 

Then we will ask data from database convert it and train our models as well as make rag of that data base and also the data that we made from logic to llm so our chatvot will be functional 


But how will we set it up in desktop   
  
Like as much as i know   
The whole code works as package right 

Now that we come to this make me understand the who application 
Where how we will use 
Like
App we do it by apk so how will we get that apk 

We will deploy the backend on server right that will be render or hostinger 

Desktop will be in user desktop 

How will we distinguish the code to each part 
I don't know anything of that 






Suppose I complete the mobile backend agent and all 
Now it's time to deploy how will things work now 
How will i seperate the code and make it work 

2nd
Suppose I have app in my phone 
Agent in desktop 
And backend on server and postgresql on database 



I understand 
I want to talk about a serious thing 
Suppose we got the data till postgresql 
It's store in db 

Now authentication process step 3 
Training the model for insights 

Let's talk about will the things I am thinking actually happen 

I was thinking app will means of course backend 
Get the data which we require make csv of it 
Then flow the ml script and at end get results 
Then according to the purpose of model do things 

I wanted to ask 

We have business sales recept purchase payment data from which we are going to predict the clients behaviour 
Like according to data when this client give money and accordingly we will do for every client 
And make a cash flow which will most close to actual money coming 
Which ai ml dl most best suited to this task 


We will from data understand clients behaviour when he actually pays and when is supposed date 
And after getting taht we will give them discounts per early day 
I what to know which is the best way to do this by ai 


I want to know 
For each model we will have to decide epoch 
And we will theortically decide the ideal ration of data quantity to how many epoch data should train 
It's important to know time 
Client set up can't wait forever 



And i want to know is it possible to have this all seamlessly 




From data we are going to predict the cash flow of user according to there clients paying habits 
If we go manually 
We will find the clients date diff in between invoice and paid then multiply with amount and then make average average of all transactions with that client 
Of course thsi value will be not in days we will make it into days 
And this is basic approch 

And another one is lstms how will that work 


And final result is a cash flow for user according to there clients paying behaviour 








We need opening balance too 
Because tally is mostly divides in years 


So i was thinking to take data from day entry there voucher will be all 4 sales and all 
Then we will get the annual data of each company 
Like tally breaks on April 2024 
we will get data from April 2024 and later from setting range of  April 2024 to till now 
And we will get opening balance for them 
Like we done transaction with them before April 2024 so that cr or dr we should know 
That will come from chart of accounting 
We have to take all this information from tally put it perfectly on database do you understand 
Now point is how we are going to do that 



Our users will have clients too many 
We will get there client vise transaction data from daybook in tally where we will select range of years or if we can we will request all the data there is from all 2 3 years 

Second is mostly data is too much for tally and it will get slow with more data so business break them by years mostly 2 3 years or else accordingly 
So we have in chart of accounting ledger where we have details of each client with opening balance 

So If we break at 31 march 2024 
Here we have closing balance 
Which will be in new tally of April 2024 will be opening balance 
Which is saved in chart of accounting 
Ledger and for each client there is data for 

You said:
but we dont just want daybook 
we also need chart of accounting 

see we want the data 
we are host 
there are users
each user have many clients 
from tally we will get the data of all the transaction like there is daybook think in tally 
i want to see according to user set the range of daybook i want to get all the data thta is available like from the break and with that we will also ask for chart of accoumtoing ledger for each client in details because from that data we will get opening balance 
so we will know user x user with y client had 2987322 cr transacion before the data which we got from after the break 

and then we need to store this data to back end
