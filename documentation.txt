Business Owner downloads app ‚Üí onboard them

Step 1: Connect Tally
- Local: Python Sync Agent connects to Tally desktop
- Cloud: Tally Web Export ‚Üí CSV/XML Upload

Step 2: Data Sync
- Auto-fetch sales, purchases, payments, receipts
- Push to your backend API (secure)

Step 3: AI & Insights Engine
- Forecast cash flow (Prophet / XGBoost / LSTM)
- Segment clients (good payers, late payers, risky)
- Predict when clients pay

Step 4: Smart Discount Logic
- For late payers: 
  - If average delay = 14 days ‚Üí Offer early-pay discount with timer
  - Show: ‚ÄúPay today to save 3% ‚Äî drops to 1% in 5 days‚Äù

Step 5: Dashboards
- üì± Accountants: Sync stats, data corrections, reports
- üëë Owners: Insights ‚Üí What‚Äôs coming in/out, risky clients, alerts

Step 6: Notifications & Nudges
- SMS / WhatsApp / Email reminders (API)
- Push notifications on mobile

# CFA AI App ‚Äì Project Summary & Technical Blueprint

## 1. Vision & Goal
- **Mobile-first SaaS** for businesses to connect their Tally ERP, extract all financial transactions, and use AI to:
  - Predict cash flow
  - Categorize clients by payment behavior
  - Automate discount recommendations
  - Empower accountants and business owners with dashboards and an LLM assistant

---

## 2. System Architecture Overview

### Main Components
- **Mobile App (React Native/Expo):** For owners/accountants to view dashboards, insights, and interact with AI.
- **Django Backend (API Server):** Receives data, manages users/companies, runs ML, and serves the mobile app.
- **PostgreSQL Database (Neon):** Stores all company, client, and transaction data.
- **Desktop Sync Agent (.exe):** Python app installed on each client‚Äôs Tally PC, fetches Tally data and pushes to backend.
- **Tally ERP (Client-side):** Local accounting software, exposes data via XML HTTP API.
- **AI/ML Engine:** Trains per-company models for client categorization and cashflow prediction.
- **LLM Assistant:** (Optional) Chatbot for business queries, powered by RAG and LLM.

---

## 3. Data Flow (End-to-End)

1. **User Onboarding:**
   - Owner/accountant signs up in the mobile app (Google OAuth).
   - Registers company; backend generates a unique API key.
   - API key is shown in the app (text + QR code).

2. **Tally Integration:**
   - User installs the desktop sync agent (.exe) on their Tally PC.
   - On first run, user enters or scans the API key.
   - Agent stores the key in `.env` and validates with backend.

3. **Automated Data Sync:**
   - Agent fetches data from Tally (XML over HTTP).
   - Converts XML to JSON.
   - Pushes data to Django backend via `/api/sync-tally/` with the API key.

4. **Backend Processing:**
   - Django matches API key to company.
   - Saves transactions, clients, and company data in PostgreSQL.
   - Triggers ML training (Celery) for client categorization and cashflow prediction.

5. **Mobile App Dashboard:**
   - Shows cashflow, client categories, discount offers, and AI chat.
   - All data is company-specific and secure.

6. **AI/ML & LLM:**
   - ML models are trained per company (no manual steps).
   - LLM assistant uses RAG to answer business questions from the database.

---

## 4. Security & Multi-Tenancy

- **API Key:** Each company gets a unique key; only their agent can push data for them.
- **Data Isolation:** All data in DB is tagged by company_id.
- **No Data Mixing:** Company A‚Äôs data is never visible to Company B.
- **HTTPS & Token Auth:** All communication is secure.

---

## 5. Database ER Diagram (Simplified)

- **User** (id, name, email, role)
- **Company** (id, name, api_key, owner_id)
- **Client** (id, name, company_id)
- **Transaction** (id, company_id, client_id, type, amount, invoice_date, payment_date)
- **ClientBehavior** (id, client_id, avg_delay_days, category)
- **DiscountOffer** (id, client_id, offer_percent, valid_until, created_by_ml)

---

## 6. Desktop Sync Agent (.exe) ‚Äì How It Works

- **GUI (Tkinter):** User enters/scans API key on first run.
- **.env File:** Stores API key and config.
- **Integrate Button:** On click, agent fetches Tally data, converts, and pushes to backend.
- **Background Scheduler:** Auto-syncs every X hours.
- **Error Handling:** Shows connection status, retries if offline.

---

## 7. Mobile App (Expo/React Native)

- **Splash ‚Üí Login (Google OAuth) ‚Üí Company Setup**
- **Dashboard:** Cashflow, client categories, discount offers
- **AI Chat:** LLM assistant for business queries
- **Settings:** Show/copy/QR API key for desktop agent

---

## 8. ML/AI Logic

- **Automated Training:** No manual ML steps; backend triggers training after each sync.
- **Features:** Client name, amount, invoice/payment dates, delay, weighted averages.
- **Categorization:** Prompt, On-Time, Late, Risky (based on average delay).
- **Discount Logic:** Dynamic offers to nudge late payers, based on ML output.

---

## 9. Key Implementation Points

- **No manual data upload:** All Tally data is fetched via XML API and pushed automatically.
- **No manual ML:** All training and categorization is automated in backend code.
- **API key matching:** Ensures each company‚Äôs data is isolated and secure.
- **Scalable:** Can support 1000+ companies, each with their own Tally and data.

---

## 10. Next Steps (What to Build)

1. **Django Models & API Endpoints:** Company, Client, Transaction, sync_tally_data, API key validation.
2. **Desktop Agent:** Python app with GUI, .env, QR scan, Tally fetch, JSON push.
3. **Mobile App:** Google login, dashboard, API key display, AI chat.
4. **ML/Celery:** Automated training and categorization jobs.
5. **LLM Assistant:** (Optional) RAG + chatbot integration.

---

## 11. Code Understanding

- **Backend:** Django REST API, PostgreSQL, Celery for background jobs, ML logic in Python.
- **Mobile:** React Native (TypeScript recommended), Expo Router for navigation, Axios for API calls.
- **Desktop Agent:** Python (requests, xmltodict, Tkinter, dotenv, schedule), packaged as .exe with PyInstaller.
- **Security:** API key for company matching, JWT for mobile login, HTTPS everywhere.

---

## 12. What‚Äôs NOT Needed

- No manual PDF/CSV parsing (unless fallback needed)
- No manual ML training or parameter tuning per client
- No backend code inside mobile/ folder
